# MariaDB Distributed SQL to Analytics with Spider Engine Demo 

## Summary

### MariaDB ColumnStore 
[MariaDB ColumnStore](https://mariadb.com/products/columnstore/) is a columnar storage engine that utilizes a massively parallel distributed data architecture. It was built by porting InfiniDB to MariaDB and has been released under the GPL license.

MariaDB ColumnStore is designed for big data scaling to process petabytes of data, linear scalability and exceptional performance with real-time response to analytical queries. It leverages the I/O benefits of columnar storage, compression, just-in-time projection, and horizontal and vertical partitioning to deliver tremendous performance when analyzing large data sets.

### MariaDB Xpand 
[MariaDB Xpand](https://mariadb.com/products/enterprise/xpand/) is a distributed SQL database with high availability, fault tolerance, and write scaling.

MariaDB Xpand supports ACID-compliant distributed SQL for modern web applications with massive workloads that require high performance and strong consistency, such as online transactional processing (OLTP). MariaDB Xpand can adapt to changes in workload or capacity requirements with elastic scale-out and scale-in. When more capacity is required, more Xpand nodes can be added. When workload is reduced, Xpand nodes can be removed.

### MariaDB Spider Engine 

[MariaDB Spider Engine](https://mariadb.com/docs/server/storage-engines/spider/) creates "virtual" Spider Tables on a Spider enabled node that clients and applications can query as if they were regular tables. For Federated Spider Tables, the Enterprise Spider storage engine uses a MariaDB foreign data wrapper to query a Data Table on one or more Data Nodes. For ODBC Spider Tables, the Enterprise Spider storage engine uses an ODBC foreign data wrapper to query an ODBC Data Source.



This is a [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/mariadb/) project to provision MariaDB Xpand and MariaDB ColumnStore with Spider Engine:

*   1 **MariaDB Xpand** Distributed SQL Developer Container for functional testing
*   1 **MariaDB ColumnStore** MariaDB ColumnStore Container with Spider Engine

## Requirements

Please install the following software packages before you begin.

*   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
*   [Xpand](https://hub.docker.com/r/mariadb/xpand-single) container image currently only supports amd64/x86-64 architecture. 
* Minimum system requirements:
    * 6GiB storage
    * 2GiB free memory
    * 2 CPU cores / threads

 More information [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/mariadb/xpand-single).


## Instructions:

Open a terminal window and clone the repository:

1.  Clone this project. <br />  
    `git clone https://github.com/mariadb-ksizemore/XpandtoSpider.git`

2.  Change directory into the newly cloned folder <br />  
    `cd XpandtoSpider`

3.  Prepare and start the Docker containers <br />  
    `docker compose up -d` 
    
4.  Download the sample bts data and import into the Xpand node <br />  
    `docker exec -it xpd1 xpd_setup` 
    
    _Note: This may take some time depending on your internet connection and machine size. Expect at least 15 mins to complete this step_

5.  Prepare the ColumnStore node and set up the sample bts Spider and ColumnStore tables <br \>  
    `docker exec -it mcs1 bootstrap`  

6.  Login to ColumnStore MariaDB <br />  
    `docker exec -it mcs1 mariadb`
    
7.  Start testing Spider Tables and Inserting data into ColumnStore Tables <br />  

    `INSERT INTO bts.airlines_cs SELECT * FROM bts.airlines_spdr;`

    `INSERT INTO bts.airports_cs SELECT * FROM bts.airports_spdr;`
    
    `INSERT INTO bts.flights_cs SELECT * FROM bts.flights_spdr;`

8. Run [sample queries](https://github.com/mariadb-ksizemore/XpandtoSpider/tree/master/queries) in Queries directory to test performance in ColumnStore
